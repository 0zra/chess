TOP Ruby final project 
[https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project]

aprox. 500 lines of code and 220 lines of tests
Some things need improving but don't want to waste time on that 
(once I finish TOP I plan on running it again so I'll improve that):

- implemet casteling & en passant
- improve domain_of method (now it doesn't include fields that are occupied_by_friend, this affects king_advance method)
- make possible to save multiple games (by name, and load tham that way)
- lots of refactoring
- implemet all the win/lose/duce options
